	The Teschenhagen station is located in the municipality of Sehlen on the
	island of Ruegen and was opened on July 1, 1883. It is located on the
	Stralsundâ€“Sassnitz railway line and has two tracks with corresponding
	platforms. Originally designed as a train station with freight traffic,
	Teschenhagen now serves as a stop for regional trains of the Ostdeutsche
	Eisenbahn GmbH (ODEG), which offer connections between Rostock, Stralsund, and
	Sassnitz or Binz. The historic reception building is still intact and was
	partially inhabited until mid-2022.
