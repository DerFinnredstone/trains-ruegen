	Stralsund Hauptbahnhof, opened in 1863 and redesigned in 1905 in neo-Gothic
	style, is the main railway hub of the Hanseatic city. It connects northern
	Germany with the island of Ruegen and major cities like Berlin and Hamburg.
	The RE9 regional train runs every two hours between Rostock and Lietzow,
	continuing alternately to Sassnitz or Ostseebad Binz. The station offers six
	tracks, barrier-free access, shops, DB services, and direct connections to
	local buses and taxis.
